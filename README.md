This program sets up a draft for each player to select a chosen number of Smash Ultimate Characters. The program will then assign each player a character from that draft at random. This is useful because my friends and I love playing Super Smash Bros, but playing the same character over and over again can get old. This program allows a random character to be chosen for us, but still allows us to select a subset of characters from the full character list that we are interested in playing.
